"""Fail a build when a cross-bank CALL does not restore the MB flag.

CALL and JMP on the 8048 carry 11 address bits; the twelfth comes from the MB
flip-flop. Macroassembler AS emits the SEL MB *before* a call whose target is in
the other bank -- and nothing after it. So this assembles clean and silently
jumps 2K low, into the console BIOS:

       800 : E5 94 05        call low_sub       ; E5 = SEL MB0
       803 : 04 00           jmp  high_sub      ; MB is still 0 -> $000

The firmware tree's answer was to keep every callable routine below $800, which
costs 1K -- and the browser cart already fills it to $7EF. This game needs ~2.5K,
so it puts code in both banks and pays one byte per call site instead:

    high-bank code:  call lo_x   ->  sel mb1   (F5)
    low-bank code:   call hi_x   ->  sel mb0   (E5)

`call lo_x` / `ret` is the subtle case: RET restores the PC but not MB, so a
high-bank caller resumes with MB=0 and its next intra-bank jump lands in the
BIOS. The restore is therefore required even when nothing in the routine itself
looks like it cares.

The one exception, and it is exact rather than a heuristic: a cross-bank call
that is IMMEDIATELY followed by another cross-bank call needs no restore between
them, because AS emits that second call's own SEL MB and it runs before anything
can observe the flag. The invariant then holds inductively -- whichever call is
last in such a run still has to restore.

Reads the AS listing rather than the binary: a raw byte stream cannot be walked
without knowing where instructions begin, and a table of card glyphs is full of
bytes that look like opcodes.

# checked by inspection: it depends on whether the target ever returns.

# One-way transfers are fine -- a screen hands off to the next screen and never
# comes back. Tail calls are not. There is no way to tell them apart from the
# byte stream, so they are declared here instead, and anything new fails the
